With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can simply upload their application code and Elastic Beanstalk will take care of deploying the code, managing the underlying infrastructure, and monitoring the application health. Elastic Beanstalk supports various application platforms such as Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker, allowing developers to choose the platform that best suits their needs.
